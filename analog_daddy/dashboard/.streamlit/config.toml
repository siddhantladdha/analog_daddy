# - style (optional)
# - unicodeRange (optional)
# To host a font with your app, enable static file serving with
# `server.enableStaticServing=true`.
# You can define multiple [[theme.fontFaces]] tables, including multiple
# tables with the same family if your font is defined by multiple files.
# For example, a font hosted with your app may have a [[theme.fontFaces]]
# table as follows:
# [[theme.fontFaces]]
# family = "font_name"

# For example, you can use "10px", "0.5rem", or "2rem". To follow best
# practices, use rem instead of pixels when specifying a numeric size.

# The radius used as basis for the corners of buttons.
# This can be one of the following:
