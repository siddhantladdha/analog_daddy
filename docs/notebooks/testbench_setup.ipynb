    "# Testbench Creation for Lookup Table Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This document shows the process to create a testbench to generate a Lookup Table (LUT) for transistor sizing.\n",
    "The how and why of this testbench is explained in [Systematic Design of Analog CMOS Circuits](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108125840).\n",
    "But the gist of it is that the LUT we are generating here is supposed to capture \"all the voltages\" and \"lengths\" a transistor could see in design.\n",
    "Make a note that we ignore the widths since most of the parameters scale linearly with width or are not affected by width to the first order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The author of the book has provided a set of scripts as a [starter kit](https://github.com/bmurmann/Book-on-gm-ID-design).\n",
    "However, upon the author's own admission \"The provided scripts are far from 'plug and play'.\n",
    "You need to look at each line in the header of the configuration file and determine appropriate adjustments for your system.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I have made the author's script work thrice in my life and it took about 5 days every time to get it working for new technology. The first time I had\n",
    "help but the last two times I was on my own and trust me, you will see stars before you get it working.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with the following \"manual\" approach the setup time can be reduced to less than 30 minutes and does not care how your netlist is generated and models are setup.\n",
    "Additionally, the biggest contributors to the headache of generating these models were `cds_srr` and the `cds_innersrr` functions. I have completely bypassed this using\n",
    "simple export from ADE-Assembler to CSV and then parsing this CSV file using Python, however, you can effectively use any language to parse this CSV file and generate a LUT.\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method might be time consuming for the simulator and my importer scripts are far from efficient, however, they are not as time consuming for the user.\n"

    "- Setup the width > 10 um.\n",
    "- Now if you have multiple device types just copy the devices and rename the new devices.\n",
    "- For example if you have a SVT, LVT and Native devices you could name them as nmos_svt, nmos_lvt, nmos_native respectively. \n",
