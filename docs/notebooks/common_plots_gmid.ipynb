    "Hopefully the [Usage Demo Notebook](./usage_demo.ipynb) made you comfortable in using the `look_up` function. Now, this notebook will have demo plots that I generally use in design using ${g_{m}}\\over{i_{d}}$ methodology which will henceforth be typed as gm_id methodology. This methodology treats gm_id as an independent variable in addition to Length and bias current. All of them when selected appropriately should give you a transistor biased to be used as an active device.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just one of the templates that I use and you can create a template of your choice and use your methodology of choice. For example, instead of gm/id as an independent variable you use [inversion coefficient as the independent variable](https://kevinfronczak.com/blog/inversion-coefficient-based-circuit-design) or any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at the core of any methodology is the Look up Table (LUT) you will access and hence the need to iterate device dimensions to achieve the correct biasing should be minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These plots will always be W.I.P, hence if you don't like certain changes you can always access the historical versions!"
